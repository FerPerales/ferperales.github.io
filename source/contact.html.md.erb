## Contact

Doesn't matter if you want to talk about bussiness or just say hi, you can find me on the internet here:


* ðŸ’¬ Need you give me a shout and 140 characters are enough? Try [Twitter](http://twitter.com/FerPeralesM).

* ðŸ’¼ If you are more the "I'd Like to Add you to My Professional Network" kind of person, I'm on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/ferperales) as well.

* ðŸ“Š Want to take a look at my slides? You can find them on [Speakerdeck](http://speakerdeck.com/ferperales).

* ðŸ“· Are you a food and travel lover as myself? You won't be dissapointed if you follow me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/ferperales).

* ðŸŽµ [Is music your occupation?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_GDUv4MI0Y) Let's share some playlist on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/ferperales) and compare out most listened bands on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/pamano).

* ðŸŽ® If you are looking for your next reliable support on DotA 2 or a second-to-none sniper at CS:GO, find me on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferperales/).

* ðŸ“š Bookworm? So am I... sort of. We can be friends at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/ferperales) if you promise to not laugh at my Reading Challenge progress.
